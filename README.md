[![project chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20zulip-brightgreen)](https://deep-symmetry.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/278354-carabiner)

A Java library for bridging Pioneer Pro DJ Link networks and
[Ableton Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/). A port of the Clojure
[beat-carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-carabiner)
(if you are working in Clojure, use that instead).

## Usage

beat-carabiner-java is available through Maven Central, so to use it in your 
project, all you need is to include the appropriate dependency.

1. Set up a Java project using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) or a compatible build system.

2. Add this project as a dependency:
   [![Maven Project](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.deepsymmetry/beat-carabiner-java.svg)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.deepsymmetry/beat-carabiner-java)

   Click the **maven central** badge above to view the repository entry
   for beat-carabiner-java. The proper format for including the latest release as a
   dependency in a variety of tools, can be found and copied in the **Snippets**
   section by choosing your build tool from the menu.

ee the [API Documentation](http://deepsymmetry.org/beat-carabiner-java/apidocs/)
for full details, but here is a nutshell guide:

**To Do: Write this!**

Although it is possible to download (or build) and start your own copy
of [Carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner) if you are
working on an operating system or processor architecture that is not
yet supported by
[lib-carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/lib-carabiner), in most
situations you can let beat-carabiner-java automatically manage an embedded
instance for you using lib-carabiner. You will need at least Java 9 to
load beat-carabiner-java, but a current release will perform better and have
more recent security updates.

#### Carabiner Version Warnings

The Clojure version of this library has a mechanism by which warnings of
Carabiner version mismatches can be passed along to whatever user interface
you are providing. This has been omitted from the Java port, mostly because
it has been so long since the older Carabiner versions have been in use that
this is unlikely to ever occur today. If it does happen, a warning will be
logged. If you need this functionality (perhaps if there is a new Carabiner
version released that adds new incompatibilities), please file a pull request
to implement it, or (less happily) an issue to request its implementation.

### Logging Configuration

beat-carabiner-java uses [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) to allow
you to integrate it with whatever Java logging framework your project
is using, so you will need to include the appropriate slf4j binding on
your class path.
